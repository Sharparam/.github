# Security Policy

This is a default security policy for repositories that don't specify their own.

<!--
## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to securely report vulnerabilities to me, you can email me securely using GPG.

You can find my public key on [my Keybase profile][keybase], and you can verify the details
if you wish on [the contact page of my personal homepage][contact-page]. The key fingerprint
is `A6B6 5DCE 2EB7 BEAE 9600 74E6 C58C 41E2 7B00 AD04`, send the emails to
[sharparam@sharparam.com](mailto:sharparam@sharparam.com).

You can also simply create an issue about the vulnerability on the relevant repository, if
you feel the vulnerability is not high-profile enough to warrant going through the hurdles
of encrypted email (my repos are unlikely to need that kind of security anyway).

Nevertheless, the option is there!

I don't always keep close track of my emails and issues, but you should be able to get an
initial response within a couple weeks.
